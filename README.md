1. Introduction
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the specifications and requirements for the development of a comprehensive web application powered by the Spring Boot framework. This application is envisioned to revolutionize the automotive industry by providing a robust platform for managing car-related information, enhancing user experience, and facilitating efficient file handling operations.

The application, tentatively named "AutoHub," seeks to bridge the gap between automobile enthusiasts, car manufacturers, and individual users. By centralizing essential car data, streamlining user interactions, and incorporating advanced file management capabilities, AutoHub aims to redefine the way users interact with the automobile ecosystem.
